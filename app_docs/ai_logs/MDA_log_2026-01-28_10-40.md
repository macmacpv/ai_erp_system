Iteration: 6

## Actions Executed
1.  **Bug Fix (UI)**: Fixed `DashboardLayout` compilation error. Replaced `subMenu.add()` with `subMenu.addItem()` and ensured correct component handling in `MenuBar`.
2.  **Personnel Module Implementation**: Created `Employee` and `Rank` entities in `modules.personnel`.
3.  **Database Migration**: Added `V2__personnel_schema.sql` with correct `BIGINT` foreign keys.
4.  **ACE Logic Update**: `Account` now aggregates permissions from `directPermissions` and the `Rank` associated with the `Employee`.
5.  **Root Handling**: Root account now bypasses the need for an `Employee` record and displays "System Owner" title.
6.  **Version Bump**: Updated version to 0.1.6.

## Status
* **Current State**: 🟣 **STATE 3: OPERATIONAL**.
* **Next Step**: Implement Roster View to manage employees and their assignments.
