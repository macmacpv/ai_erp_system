Iteration: 16

## Actions Executed
1.  **ACE Logic Upgrade**: Implemented wildcard matching (`*`, `node.*`) in `Account.java`.
2.  **Wildcard Matching**: Added `hasPermission(String node)` to support hierarchical permission checks.
3.  **Security Enhancement**: Only `root` can now see the "ROOT" section in the `DashboardLayout`.
4.  **Restricted Nodes**: Established logic where nodes starting with `sys.` or `restricted.` are reserved for the System Owner (root).
5.  **Scoped Management**: Implemented logic foundation for `*.permissions.edit`, allowing departmental managers to manage only their specific sub-permissions.
6.  **Version Bump**: Updated version to 0.1.16.

## Status
* **Current State**: 🟣 **STATE 3: OPERATIONAL**.
* **Next Step**: Proceed to Employee CRUD, ensuring the new permission logic is used to restrict access to the creation/editing of officer files.
