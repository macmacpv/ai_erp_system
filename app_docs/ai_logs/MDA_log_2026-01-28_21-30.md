Date: 2026-01-28 21:30 UTC
Iteration: 17

## Actions Executed
1.  **Database Migration (V5, V6)**: Added global wildcard `*` to permissions and created `app_notifications` table.
2.  **Internationalization (I18n)**: Implemented `I18NProviderImpl` and created `messages.properties`. Moved all UI strings (Login, Dashboard, Navbar, Titles) to properties.
3.  **Notification System**:
    *   Created `Notify` utility for themed Toast notifications (Bottom-Right).
    *   Implemented `AppNotification` entity and repository for persistent alerts.
    *   Added `NotificationBell` component to `DashboardLayout` with real-time Badge updates.
4.  **Security Logic**: Updated `Account.canManagePermission` to explicitly protect the `*` node.
5.  **Testing**: Added notification test buttons to `DashboardPage`.
6.  **Version Bump**: Updated version to 0.1.17.

## Status
* **Current State**: 🟣 **STATE 3: OPERATIONAL**.
* **Next Step**: Permission system and Notifications are solid. Ready for Employee CRUD and Account linking.
