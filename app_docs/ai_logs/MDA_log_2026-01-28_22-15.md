Iteration: 18

## Actions Executed
1.  **Bug Fix**: Replaced deprecated `new Locale("pl")` with `Locale.forLanguageTag("pl")` in `I18NProviderImpl`.
2.  **Real-Time Push Integration**:
    *   Created `AppNotificationService` to handle both DB persistence and real-time broadcasting.
    *   Updated `NotificationBell` to listen to `Broadcaster` events and trigger UI updates via `ui.access()`.
3.  **UI/UX Refinement (CSS)**:
    *   Hardcoded sharp corners (`border-radius: 0`) for notifications.
    *   Implemented Desktop/Mobile responsive logic for Toasts (Full-width top on mobile, 25% bottom-right on desktop).
    *   Widened Notification Bell popover to 450px and ensured text wrapping.
4.  **Notify Utility**: Removed close buttons as per instructions.
5.  **Version Bump**: Updated version to 0.1.18.

## Status
* **Current State**: 🟣 **STATE 3: OPERATIONAL**.
* **Next Step**: Everything is ready for the Employee CRUD. Real-time notifications and I18n are fully functional.
