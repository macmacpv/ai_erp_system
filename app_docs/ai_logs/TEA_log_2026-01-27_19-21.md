# TEA Log
Date: 2026-01-27 19:21 UTC
Iteration: 3

## Actions Executed
1.  **Context Update**: Executed context management tools to prepare for **FCA**.
    *   ran `python tools/list_project_tree.py`: Updated `reconstructor-file-list.txt`.
    *   ran `python tools/serializer.py`: Updated `SERIALIZED_CONTEXT.txt` (and likely `RECONSTRUCTOR_CONTEXT.md` if the tool does that, otherwise it prepares the text file).

## Status
*   **Current State**: 🟡 **STATE 1: FOUNDATION**
*   **Ready for Agent Change**: Context is serialized. The system is ready for the **FCA** to take over and create the Vision Document (`vision.md`).
